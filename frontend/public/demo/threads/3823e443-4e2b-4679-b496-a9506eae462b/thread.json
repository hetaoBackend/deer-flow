She spearheaded ImageNet, the dataset that sparked the deep-learning revolution we’re living right now, served as Google Cloud’s Chief AI Scientist, directed Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, and co-founded Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. In this conversation, Fei-Fei shares the rarely told history of how we got here—including the wild fact that just nine years ago, calling yourself an AI company was basically a death sentence.\\n\\n*We discuss:*\\n1. How ImageNet helped spark the AI explosion we’re living through\\n2. Why world models and spatial intelligence represent the next frontier in AI, beyond large language models\\n3. Why Fei-Fei believes AI won’t replace humans but will require us to take responsibility for ourselves\\n4. The surprising applications of Marble, from movie production to psychological research\\n5. Why robotics faces unique challenges compared with language models and what’s needed to overcome them\\n6.

FEI-FEI LI QUOTES FROM THE INTERVIEW\n\n**“Really, at the end of the day, people are at the heart of everything. People made AI, people will be using AI, people will be impacted by AI, and people should have a say in AI.”**  \n— Dr. Fei-Fei Li\n\n**“It turned out what physics taught me was not just the math and physics. It was really this passion to ask audacious questions.”**  \n— Dr. Fei-Fei Li\n\n**“We’re all students of history. One thing I actually don’t like about the telling of scientific history is there’s too much focus on single genius.”**  \n— Dr. Fei-Fei Li\n\n**“AI is absolutely a civilizational technology. I define civilizational technology in the sense that, because of the power of this technology, it’ll have—or [is] already having—a profound impact in the economic, social, cultural, political, downstream effects of our society.”**  \n— Dr. Fei-Fei Li\n\n**“I believe humanity is the only species that builds civilizations. Animals build colonies or herds, but we build civilizations, and we build civilizations because we want to be better and better.”**  \n— Dr. Fei-Fei Li\n\n**“What is your North Star?”**  \n— Dr. Fei-Fei Li\n\n---\n\n**This episode is brought to you by [Seed’s DS-01 Daily Synbiotic](https://seed.com/tim)!**Seed’s [DS-01](https://seed.com/tim) was recommended to me more than a year ago by a PhD microbiologist, so I started using it well before their team ever reached out to me.

She spearheaded ImageNet, the dataset that sparked the deep-learning revolution we’re living right now, served as Google Cloud’s Chief AI Scientist, directed Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, and co-founded Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. In this conversation, Fei-Fei shares the rarely told history of how we got here—including the wild fact that just nine years ago, calling yourself an AI company was basically a death sentence.\n\n**We discuss:**\n\n1. How ImageNet helped spark the AI explosion we’re living through [[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctjiatnd6Xk&t=577s)]\n2. Why world models and spatial intelligence represent the next frontier in AI, beyond large language models [[23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctjiatnd6Xk&t=1433s)]\n3. Why Fei-Fei believes AI won’t replace humans but will require us to take responsibility for ourselves [[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctjiatnd6Xk&t=331s)]\n4. The surprising applications of Marble, from movie production to psychological research [[48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctjiatnd6Xk&t=2882s)]\n5. Why robotics faces unique challenges compared with language models and what’s needed to overcome them [[40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctjiatnd6Xk&t=2445s)]\n6.

She spearheaded ImageNet, the dataset that sparked the deep-learning revolution we’re living right now, served as Google Cloud’s Chief AI Scientist, directed Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, and co-founded Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. In this conversation, Fei-Fei shares the rarely told history of how we got here—including the wild fact that just nine years ago, calling yourself an AI company was basically a death sentence.\\n\\n*We discuss:*\\n1. How ImageNet helped spark the AI explosion we’re living through\\n2. Why world models and spatial intelligence represent the next frontier in AI, beyond large language models\\n3. Why Fei-Fei believes AI won’t replace humans but will require us to take responsibility for ourselves\\n4. The surprising applications of Marble, from movie production to psychological research\\n5. Why robotics faces unique challenges compared with language models and what’s needed to overcome them\\n6.
