Let me explain MOE (Mixture of Experts) in AI like you're talking to a friend.\n\nImagine you have a group of friends, and each one is super good at something different:\n- Alex is a math whiz who can solve any numbers problem\n- Sam is a sports expert who knows all the rules and stats\n- Jamie is an art genius who can draw anything\n- Taylor is a video game master who can beat any level\n\nNow, when you have a question, you don't ask all of them at once - that would be confusing and slow! Instead, you quickly figure out which friend is the right expert for that specific question, and only ask them.\n\n**That's basically what MOE (Mixture of Experts) is in AI!**\n\nIn an AI model with MOE:\n1. **Different \"expert\" parts** specialize in different types of information (like your friends with different skills)\n2. A **smart router** (like you deciding who to ask) quickly figures out which expert should handle each piece of information\n3. Only the **right experts** get activated for each task, making everything faster and smarter\n\n**Why is this cool for AI?**\n- It's like having a whole team of specialists instead of one generalist\n- The AI can be much bigger and smarter without being slower\n- Different parts of the model become really good at specific things\n- It's more efficient - like only waking up the experts who are needed\n\n**Real-world example:** Some of the biggest AI models (like certain versions of GPT) use MOE to handle all the different types of questions people ask - from math problems to story writing to coding help.\n\nThink of it like a superhero team where each hero has their own special power, and the team leader (the router) sends the right hero for each mission. That way, the whole team works together perfectly without getting in each other's way!\n\nPretty neat, right? It's one of the ways AI researchers make models that are both super smart and fast enough to help us in real time.",

I need to explain Mixture of Experts to a 12-year-old boy. That's challenging but doable. I should break it down with simple analogies. Let me think of a good explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept well myself. I could search for \"Mixture of Experts explained simply\" or \"MOE AI for kids\". But I can also rely on my knowledge. Mixture of Experts is a neural network architecture where different sub-networks (experts) specialize in different types of data, and a gating network decides which expert to use for each input. Like having a team of specialists.\n\nFor a 12-year-old: use analogies like a group of friends where each is good at something different (math, sports, art), and you ask the right friend for help depending on the problem. Or a video game where different characters have different skills, and you choose the best character for each level.\n\nI'll craft a simple, engaging explanation. Use examples they can relate to. Maybe mention how it's used in large language models like GPT-4. Keep it fun and avoid technical jargon.\n\nI should also consider if there are other AI-related MOE acronyms: maybe \"Mixture of Experts\" is the most common. Could also be \"Model of Everything\" but less likely. I'll assume Mixture of Experts.\n\nLet me write the explanation. First, start with a friendly tone. Use the analogy of a team of experts. Explain how it helps AI be smarter and faster. Keep it to a few paragraphs.\n\nI'll produce the final answer now. No need for tools. Just deliver the explanation."

Supports structured prompts and reference images for guided generation.\n---\n\n# Image Generation Skill\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill enables Claude to generate high-quality images using structured prompts and the DeepSeek v3.2 model via a Python script. The workflow includes creating JSON-formatted prompts and executing image generation with optional reference images.\n\n## Core Capabilities\n\n- Create structured JSON prompts for AIGC image generation\n- Support multiple reference images for style/composition guidance\n- Generate images through automated Python script execution\n- Handle various image generation scenarios (character design, scenes, products, etc.)\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Understand Requirements\n\nWhen a user requests image generation, identify:\n\n- Subject/content: What should be in the image\n- Style preferences: Art style, mood, color palette\n- Technical specs: Aspect ratio, composition, lighting\n- Reference images: Any images to guide generation\n- You don't need to check the folder under `/mnt/user-data`\n\n### Step 2: Create Structured Prompt\n\nGenerate a structured JSON file in `/mnt/user-data/workspace/` with naming pattern: `{descriptive-name}.json`\n\n### Step 3: Execute Generation\n\nCall the Python script:\n```bash\npython /mnt/skills/public/image-generation/scripts/generate.py \\\n  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/prompt-file.json \\\n  --reference-images /path/to/ref1.jpg /path/to/ref2.png \\\n  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/generated-image.jpg\n  --aspect-ratio 16:9\n```\n\nParameters:\n\n- `--prompt-file`: Absolute path to JSON prompt file (required)\n- `--reference-images`: Absolute paths to reference images (optional, space-separated)\n- `--output-file`: Absolute path to output image file (required)\n- `--aspect-ratio`: Aspect ratio of the generated image (optional, default: 16:9)\n\n[!NOTE]\nDo NOT read the python file, instead just call it with the parameters.\n\n## Character Generation Example\n\nUser request: \"Create a Tokyo street style woman character in 1990s\"\n\nCreate prompt file: `/mnt/user-data/workspace/asian-woman.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"character\": {\n    \"gender\": \"female\",\n    \"age\": \"mid-20s\",\n    \"ethnicity\": \"Japanese\",\n    \"body_type\": \"slender, elegant\",\n    \"facial_features\": \"delicate features, expressive eyes, subtle makeup with emphasis on lips, long dark hair partially wet from rain\",\n    \"clothing\": \"stylish trench coat, designer handbag, high heels, contemporary Tokyo street fashion\",\n    \"accessories\": \"minimal jewelry, statement earrings, leather handbag\",\n    \"era\": \"1990s\"\n  },\n  \"negative_prompt\": \"blurry face, deformed, low quality, overly sharp digital look, oversaturated colors, artificial lighting, studio setting, posed, selfie angle\",\n  \"style\": \"Leica M11 street photography aesthetic, film-like rendering, natural color palette with slight warmth, bokeh background blur, analog photography feel\",\n  \"composition\": \"medium shot, rule of thirds, subject slightly off-center, environmental context of Tokyo street visible, shallow depth of field isolating subject\",\n  \"lighting\": \"neon lights from signs and storefronts, wet pavement reflections, soft ambient city glow, natural street lighting, rim lighting from background neons\",\n  \"color_palette\": \"muted naturalistic tones, warm skin tones, cool blue and magenta neon accents, desaturated compared to digital photography, film grain texture\"\n}\n```\n\nExecute generation:\n```bash\npython /mnt/skills/public/image-generation/scripts/generate.py \\\n  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/cyberpunk-hacker.json \\\n  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/cyberpunk-hacker-01.jpg \\\n  --aspect-ratio 2:3\n```\n\nWith reference images:\n```json\n{\n  \"character\": {\n    \"gender\": \"based on [Image 1]\",\n    \"age\": \"based on [Image 1]\",\n    \"ethnicity\": \"human from [Image 1] adapted to Star Wars universe\",\n    \"body_type\": \"based on [Image 1]\",\n    \"facial_features\": \"matching [Image 1] with slight weathered look from space travel\",\n    \"clothing\": \"Star Wars style outfit - worn leather jacket with utility vest, cargo pants with tactical pouches, scuffed boots, belt with holster\",\n    \"accessories\": \"blaster pistol on hip, comlink device on wrist, goggles pushed up on forehead, satchel with supplies, personal vehicle based on [Image 2]\",\n    \"era\": \"Star Wars universe, post-Empire era\"\n  },\n  \"prompt\": \"Character inspired by [Image 1] standing next to a vehicle inspired by [Image 2] on a bustling alien planet street in Star Wars universe aesthetic. Character wearing worn leather jacket with utility vest, cargo pants with tactical pouches, scuffed boots, belt with blaster holster.

Here's what you'll see in the comic:\n\n**The Story:**\nNobita is overwhelmed with all his schoolwork (math, science, history) and doesn't know how to handle everything. Doraemon comes to the rescue with his \"Mixture of Experts Device\"!\n\n**How it explains MOE:**\n1. **Panel 1-2:** Nobita's problem (too much to handle) → Doraemon introduces the MOE gadget\n2. **Panel 3-4:** Each friend becomes an \"expert\" - Shizuka (science), Giant (math), Suneo (art)\n3. **Panel 5:** Doraemon explains he's the \"router\" who sends questions to the right expert\n4. **Panel 6-7:** Nobita asks a math problem → Doraemon routes it to Giant → Giant solves it quickly\n5. **Panel 8:** The lesson - MOE = specialists + smart router = super efficient AI!\n\n**The Visual Metaphor:**\n- Each friend = a specialized \"expert\" in the AI model\n- Doraemon = the \"router\" that directs questions\n- Only the right expert gets activated for each task\n- Much faster and more efficient than trying to do everything yourself\n\nThe comic shows how MOE works in AI models - instead of one big brain trying to do everything, you have a team of specialists, and a smart system that knows who to ask for each type of question. Just like Nobita learning to ask the right friend for help!\n\nCheck out the comic image I've generated - it visually explains the concept in a fun, Doraemon-style way that a 12-year-old would understand!",
