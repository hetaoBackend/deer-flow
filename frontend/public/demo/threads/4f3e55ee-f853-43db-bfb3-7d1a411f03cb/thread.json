They contained no actual\ncomplaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication\nof present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was\na want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize\nher style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a\nmind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been\nscarcely ever clouded. [Elizabeth](ppdrmtis.html#ElizabethBennet)\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention\nwhich it had hardly received on the first perusal.\n[Mr. Darcy's](ppdrmtis.html#FitzwilliamDarcy) shameful boast of\nwhat misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of\n[her sister's](ppdrmtis.html#JaneBennet) sufferings. It was some\nconsolation to think that his visit to\n[Rosings](ppjalmap.html#rosings) was to end on the day after the\nnext, and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\nwith [Jane](ppdrmtis.html#JaneBennet) again, and enabled to\ncontribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do.\n\nShe could not think of [Darcy's](ppdrmtis.html#FitzwilliamDarcy)\nleaving [Kent](ppjalmap.html#ppkent) without remembering that his\ncousin was to go with him; but\n[Colonel Fitzwilliam](ppdrmtis.html#ColFitzwilliam)\nhad made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was,\nshe did not mean to be unhappy about him.\n\nWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door\nbell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being\n[Colonel Fitzwilliam](ppdrmtis.html#ColFitzwilliam) himself, who\nhad once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire\nparticularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were\nvery differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw\n[Mr. Darcy](ppdrmtis.html#FitzwilliamDarcy) walk\ninto the room.\nIn an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health,\nimputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered\nhim with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up,\nwalked about the room. [Elizabeth](ppdrmtis.html#ElizabethBennet)\nwas surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he\ncame towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began,\n\n``In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\nrepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\nyou.''\n\n[Elizabeth's](ppdrmtis.html#ElizabethBennet) astonishment was\nbeyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he\nconsidered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and\nhad long felt for her immediately followed. He spoke well, but there were\nfeelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and\nhe was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness\nthan of [pride](pridprej.html#pride). His sense of\nher inferiority -- of its being a degradation -- of the family obstacles which\njudgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which\nseemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to\nrecommend his suit.\n\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not\nbe insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her\nintentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he\nwas to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she\nlost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\nanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\nrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his\nendeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope\nthat it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this,\nshe could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He\n*spoke* of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real\nsecurity. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he\nceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,\n\n``In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a\nsense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be\nreturned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could\n*feel* gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot -- I have never\ndesired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most\nunwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one. It has been most\nunconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The\nfeelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your\nregard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this\nexplanation.''\n\n[Mr. Darcy](ppdrmtis.html#FitzwilliamDarcy), who was leaning\nagainst the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her\nwords with no less resentment than surprise. His\ncomplexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible\nin every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and\nwould not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it. The\npause was to [Elizabeth's](ppdrmtis.html#ElizabethBennet) feelings\ndreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,\n\n``And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I\nmight, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little *endeavour* at\ncivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.''\n\n``I might as well enquire,'' replied she, ``why, with so evident a design of\noffending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against\nyour will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this\nsome excuse for incivility, if I *was* uncivil? But I have other\nprovocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided against you,\nhad they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that\nany consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of\nruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of\n[a most beloved sister](ppdrmtis.html#JaneBennet)?''\n\nAs she pronounced these words,\n[Mr. Darcy](ppdrmtis.html#FitzwilliamDarcy) changed colour; but\nthe emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her\nwhile she continued.\n\n``I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\nexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted *there*. You dare not,\nyou cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of\ndividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for\ncaprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and\ninvolving them both in misery of the acutest kind.''\n\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with\nan air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even\nlooked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\n\n``Can you deny that you have done it?'' she repeated.\n\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied, ``I have no wish of denying that\nI did every thing in my power to separate\n[my friend](ppdrmtis.html#CharlesBingley) from\n[your sister](ppdrmtis.html#JaneBennet), or that I rejoice in my\nsuccess. Towards *him* I have been kinder than towards myself.''\n\n[Elizabeth](ppdrmtis.html#ElizabethBennet) disdained the\nappearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape,\nnor was it likely to conciliate, her.\n\n``But it is not merely this affair,'' she continued, ``on which my dislike is\nfounded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided. Your\ncharacter was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from\n[Mr. Wickham](ppdrmtis.html#GeorgeWickham). On this subject,\nwhat can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here\ndefend yourself? or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon\nothers?''\n\n``You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,'' said\n[Darcy](ppdrmtis.html#FitzwilliamDarcy) in a less tranquil tone,\nand with a heightened colour.\n\n``Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an\ninterest in him?''\n\n``His misfortunes!'' repeated\n[Darcy](ppdrmtis.html#FitzwilliamDarcy) contemptuously; ``yes, his\nmisfortunes have been great indeed.''\n\n``And of your infliction,'' cried\n[Elizabeth](ppdrmtis.html#ElizabethBennet) with energy. ``You have\nreduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty. You have\nwithheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him.\nYou have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was\nno less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can\ntreat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.''\n\n``And this,'' cried [Darcy](ppdrmtis.html#FitzwilliamDarcy), as he\nwalked with quick steps across the room, ``is your opinion of me! This is the\nestimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My\nfaults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,'' added\nhe, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, ``these offences might have\nbeen overlooked, had not your\n[pride](pridprej.html#pride) been hurt by my honest\nconfession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious\ndesign. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with\ngreater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of\nmy being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination\n-- by reason, by reflection, by every thing. But disguise of every sort is my\nabhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural\nand just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\nconnections? To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition\nin life is so decidedly beneath my own?''\n\n[Elizabeth](ppdrmtis.html#ElizabethBennet) felt herself growing\nmore angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure\nwhen she said,\n\n``You are mistaken,\n[Mr. Darcy](ppdrmtis.html#FitzwilliamDarcy), if you suppose\nthat the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it\nspared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had\nyou behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.''\n\nShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,\n\n``You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that\nwould have tempted me to accept it.''\n\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression\nof mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on.\n\n``From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my\nacquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with\nthe fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain\nof the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of\ndisapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike;\nand I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in\nthe world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.''\n\n``You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings,\nand have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for\nhaving taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your\nhealth and happiness.''\n\nAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and\n[Elizabeth](ppdrmtis.html#ElizabethBennet) heard him the next\nmoment open the front door and quit the house.\n\nThe tumult of her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to\nsupport herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.\nHer astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every\nreview of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from\n[Mr. Darcy](ppdrmtis.html#FitzwilliamDarcy)! that he should\nhave been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to\nmarry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent\n[his friend's](ppdrmtis.html#CharlesBingley) marrying\n[her sister](ppdrmtis.html#JaneBennet), and which must appear at\nleast with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! It was\ngratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his\n[pride](pridprej.html#pride), his abominable pride,\nhis shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to\n[Jane](ppdrmtis.html#JaneBennet), his unpardonable assurance in\nacknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in\nwhich he had mentioned\n[Mr. Wickham](ppdrmtis.html#GeorgeWickham), his cruelty towards\nwhom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the\nconsideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.\n\nShe continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of\n[Lady Catherine's](ppdrmtis.html#LadyCatherineDeBourgh) carriage\nmade her feel how unequal she was to encounter\n[Charlotte's](ppdrmtis.html#CharlotteLucas) observation, and\nhurried her away to her room.\n\n![](jasilhpp.gif)\n  \n![*](down.gif)[Go to next chapter.](ppv2n35.html) ![*](up.gif)[Go to start of chapter.](#BEGIN) ![*](up.gif)[Go to prev. chapter.](ppv2n33.html)\n  \n![*](right.gif)[Go to chronology.](ppchron.html) ![*](right.gif)[Go to charact. list.](ppdrmtis.html) ![*](right.gif)[Go to topics list.](pptopics.html)\n  \n![*](right.gif)[Go to Pride&Prej. motifs.](pridprej.html#pride) ![*](right.gif)[Go to place list/map.](ppjalmap.html) ![*](returns.gif)[Go to table of contents.](pridprej.html#toc)\n\n![](jasilhpp.gif)\n![*](down.gif)\n![*](up.gif)\n![*](up.gif)\n![*](right.gif)\n![*](right.gif)\n![*](right.gif)\n![*](right.gif)\n![*](right.gif)\n![*](returns.gif)\n![](/pemb/headers/images/Final-2011/teenyquick-frame.jpg)\n\n![- Jane Austen | Republic of Pemberley -](https://pemberley.com/pemb/headers/images/notlost.jpg)  \n\n[Quick Index](/qindex.html) ![](/pemb/headers/images/diamond_tan.gif) [Home](/index.html) ![](/pemb/headers/images/diamond_tan.gif) [Site Map](/map.html) ![](/pemb/headers/images/diamond_tan.gif) [JAInfo](/janeinfo/janeinfo.html)\n\n© 2004 - 2011 The Republic of Pemberley\n\n[![Get copyright permissions](/pemb/headers/images/permissions.jpg)](http://www.copyright.com/search.do?operation=show&page=simple)\n\n\n\n![Quantcast](//pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-01vbvFeGGw7vE.gif)\n\n![- Jane Austen | Republic of Pemberley -](https://pemberley.com/pemb/headers/images/notlost.jpg)\n\n[Quick Index](/qindex.html) ![](/pemb/headers/images/diamond_tan.gif) [Home](/index.html) ![](/pemb/headers/images/diamond_tan.gif) [Site Map](/map.html) ![](/pemb/headers/images/diamond_tan.gif) [JAInfo](/janeinfo/janeinfo.html)\n\n![](/pemb/headers/images/diamond_tan.gif)\n![](/pemb/headers/images/diamond_tan.gif)\n![](/pemb/headers/images/diamond_tan.gif)\n\n© 2004 - 2011 The Republic of Pemberley\n\n[![Get copyright permissions](/pemb/headers/images/permissions.jpg)](http://www.copyright.com/search.do?operation=show&page=simple)\n\n\n\n![Quantcast](//pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-01vbvFeGGw7vE.gif)\n\n[![Get copyright permissions](/pemb/headers/images/permissions.jpg)](http://www.copyright.com/search.do?operation=show&page=simple)\n\n\n\n![Quantcast](//pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-01vbvFeGGw7vE.gif)\n\n![Get copyright permissions](/pemb/headers/images/permissions.jpg)\n![Quantcast](//pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-01vbvFeGGw7vE.gif)",

        "content": "---\nname: video-generation\ndescription: Use this skill when the user requests to generate, create, or imagine videos. Supports structured prompts and reference image for guided generation.\n---\n\n# Video Generation Skill\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill generates high-quality videos using structured prompts and a Python script. The workflow includes creating JSON-formatted prompts and executing video generation with optional reference image.\n\n## Core Capabilities\n\n- Create structured JSON prompts for AIGC video generation\n- Support reference image as guidance or the first/last frame of the video\n- Generate videos through automated Python script execution\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Understand Requirements\n\nWhen a user requests video generation, identify:\n\n- Subject/content: What should be in the image\n- Style preferences: Art style, mood, color palette\n- Technical specs: Aspect ratio, composition, lighting\n- Reference image: Any image to guide generation\n- You don't need to check the folder under `/mnt/user-data`\n\n### Step 2: Create Structured Prompt\n\nGenerate a structured JSON file in `/mnt/user-data/workspace/` with naming pattern: `{descriptive-name}.json`\n\n### Step 3: Create Reference Image (Optional when image-generation skill is available)\n\nGenerate reference image for the video generation.\n\n- If only 1 image is provided, use it as the guided frame of the video\n\n### Step 3: Execute Generation\n\nCall the Python script:\n```bash\npython /mnt/skills/public/video-generation/scripts/generate.py \\\n  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/prompt-file.json \\\n  --reference-images /path/to/ref1.jpg \\\n  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/generated-video.mp4 \\\n  --aspect-ratio 16:9\n```\n\nParameters:\n\n- `--prompt-file`: Absolute path to JSON prompt file (required)\n- `--reference-images`: Absolute paths to reference image (optional)\n- `--output-file`: Absolute path to output image file (required)\n- `--aspect-ratio`: Aspect ratio of the generated image (optional, default: 16:9)\n\n[!NOTE]\nDo NOT read the python file, instead just call it with the parameters.\n\n## Video Generation Example\n\nUser request: \"Generate a short video clip depicting the opening scene from \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\"\n\nStep 1: Search for the opening scene of \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" online\n\nStep 2: Create a JSON prompt file with the following content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"The Chronicles of Narnia - Train Station Farewell\",\n  \"background\": {\n    \"description\": \"World War II evacuation scene at a crowded London train station. Steam and smoke fill the air as children are being sent to the countryside to escape the Blitz.\",\n    \"era\": \"1940s wartime Britain\",\n    \"location\": \"London railway station platform\"\n  },\n  \"characters\": [\"Mrs. Pevensie\", \"Lucy Pevensie\"],\n  \"camera\": {\n    \"type\": \"Close-up two-shot\",\n    \"movement\": \"Static with subtle handheld movement\",\n    \"angle\": \"Profile view, intimate framing\",\n    \"focus\": \"Both faces in focus, background soft bokeh\"\n  },\n  \"dialogue\": [\n    {\n      \"character\": \"Mrs. Pevensie\",\n      \"text\": \"You must be brave for me, darling. I'll come for you... I promise.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"character\": \"Lucy Pevensie\",\n      \"text\": \"I will be, mother. I promise.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"audio\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"Train whistle blows (signaling departure)\",\n      \"volume\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"Strings swell emotionally, then fade\",\n      \"volume\": 0.5\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"Ambient sound of the train station\",\n      \"volume\": 0.5\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nStep 3: Use the image-generation skill to generate the reference image\n\nLoad the image-generation skill and generate a single reference image `narnia-farewell-scene-01.jpg` according to the skill.\n\nStep 4: Use the generate.py script to generate the video\n```bash\npython /mnt/skills/public/video-generation/scripts/generate.py \\\n  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/narnia-farewell-scene.json \\\n  --reference-images /mnt/user-data/outputs/narnia-farewell-scene-01.jpg \\\n  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/narnia-farewell-scene-01.mp4 \\\n  --aspect-ratio 16:9\n```\n> Do NOT read the python file, just call it with the parameters.\n\n## Output Handling\n\nAfter generation:\n\n- Videos are typically saved in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`\n- Share generated videos (come first) with user as well as generated image if applicable, using `present_files` tool\n- Provide brief description of the generation result\n- Offer to iterate if adjustments needed\n\n## Notes\n\n- Always use English for prompts regardless of user's language\n- JSON format ensures structured, parsable prompts\n- Reference image enhance generation quality significantly\n- Iterative refinement is normal for optimal results\n",

Supports structured prompts and reference images for guided generation.\n---\n\n# Image Generation Skill\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill generates high-quality images using structured prompts and a Python script. The workflow includes creating JSON-formatted prompts and executing image generation with optional reference images.\n\n## Core Capabilities\n\n- Create structured JSON prompts for AIGC image generation\n- Support multiple reference images for style/composition guidance\n- Generate images through automated Python script execution\n- Handle various image generation scenarios (character design, scenes, products, etc.)\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Understand Requirements\n\nWhen a user requests image generation, identify:\n\n- Subject/content: What should be in the image\n- Style preferences: Art style, mood, color palette\n- Technical specs: Aspect ratio, composition, lighting\n- Reference images: Any images to guide generation\n- You don't need to check the folder under `/mnt/user-data`\n\n### Step 2: Create Structured Prompt\n\nGenerate a structured JSON file in `/mnt/user-data/workspace/` with naming pattern: `{descriptive-name}.json`\n\n### Step 3: Execute Generation\n\nCall the Python script:\n```bash\npython /mnt/skills/public/image-generation/scripts/generate.py \\\n  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/prompt-file.json \\\n  --reference-images /path/to/ref1.jpg /path/to/ref2.png \\\n  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/generated-image.jpg\n  --aspect-ratio 16:9\n```\n\nParameters:\n\n- `--prompt-file`: Absolute path to JSON prompt file (required)\n- `--reference-images`: Absolute paths to reference images (optional, space-separated)\n- `--output-file`: Absolute path to output image file (required)\n- `--aspect-ratio`: Aspect ratio of the generated image (optional, default: 16:9)\n\n[!NOTE]\nDo NOT read the python file, just call it with the parameters.\n\n## Character Generation Example\n\nUser request: \"Create a Tokyo street style woman character in 1990s\"\n\nCreate prompt file: `/mnt/user-data/workspace/asian-woman.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"characters\": [{\n    \"gender\": \"female\",\n    \"age\": \"mid-20s\",\n    \"ethnicity\": \"Japanese\",\n    \"body_type\": \"slender, elegant\",\n    \"facial_features\": \"delicate features, expressive eyes, subtle makeup with emphasis on lips, long dark hair partially wet from rain\",\n    \"clothing\": \"stylish trench coat, designer handbag, high heels, contemporary Tokyo street fashion\",\n    \"accessories\": \"minimal jewelry, statement earrings, leather handbag\",\n    \"era\": \"1990s\"\n  }],\n  \"negative_prompt\": \"blurry face, deformed, low quality, overly sharp digital look, oversaturated colors, artificial lighting, studio setting, posed, selfie angle\",\n  \"style\": \"Leica M11 street photography aesthetic, film-like rendering, natural color palette with slight warmth, bokeh background blur, analog photography feel\",\n  \"composition\": \"medium shot, rule of thirds, subject slightly off-center, environmental context of Tokyo street visible, shallow depth of field isolating subject\",\n  \"lighting\": \"neon lights from signs and storefronts, wet pavement reflections, soft ambient city glow, natural street lighting, rim lighting from background neons\",\n  \"color_palette\": \"muted naturalistic tones, warm skin tones, cool blue and magenta neon accents, desaturated compared to digital photography, film grain texture\"\n}\n```\n\nExecute generation:\n```bash\npython /mnt/skills/public/image-generation/scripts/generate.py \\\n  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/cyberpunk-hacker.json \\\n  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/cyberpunk-hacker-01.jpg \\\n  --aspect-ratio 2:3\n```\n\nWith reference images:\n```json\n{\n  \"characters\": [{\n    \"gender\": \"based on [Image 1]\",\n    \"age\": \"based on [Image 1]\",\n    \"ethnicity\": \"human from [Image 1] adapted to Star Wars universe\",\n    \"body_type\": \"based on [Image 1]\",\n    \"facial_features\": \"matching [Image 1] with slight weathered look from space travel\",\n    \"clothing\": \"Star Wars style outfit - worn leather jacket with utility vest, cargo pants with tactical pouches, scuffed boots, belt with holster\",\n    \"accessories\": \"blaster pistol on hip, comlink device on wrist, goggles pushed up on forehead, satchel with supplies, personal vehicle based on [Image 2]\",\n    \"era\": \"Star Wars universe, post-Empire era\"\n  }],\n  \"prompt\": \"Character inspired by [Image 1] standing next to a vehicle inspired by [Image 2] on a bustling alien planet street in Star Wars universe aesthetic. Character wearing worn leather jacket with utility vest, cargo pants with tactical pouches, scuffed boots, belt with blaster holster. The vehicle adapted to Star Wars aesthetic with weathered metal panels, repulsor engines, desert dust covering, parked on the street. Exotic alien marketplace street with multi-level architecture, weathered metal structures, hanging market stalls with colorful awnings, alien species walking by as background characters. Twin suns casting warm golden light, atmospheric dust particles in air, moisture vaporators visible in distance. Gritty lived-in Star Wars aesthetic, practical effects look, film grain texture, cinematic composition.\",\n  \"negative_prompt\": \"clean futuristic look, sterile environment, overly CGI appearance, fantasy medieval elements, Earth architecture, modern city\",\n  \"style\": \"Star Wars original trilogy aesthetic, lived-in universe, practical effects inspired, cinematic film look, slightly desaturated with warm tones\",\n  \"composition\": \"medium wide shot, character in foreground with alien street extending into background, environmental storytelling, rule of thirds\",\n  \"lighting\": \"warm golden hour lighting from twin suns, rim lighting on character, atmospheric haze, practical light sources from market stalls\",\n  \"color_palette\": \"warm sandy tones, ochre and sienna, dusty blues, weathered metals, muted earth colors with pops of alien market colors\",\n  \"technical\": {\n    \"aspect_ratio\": \"9:16\",\n    \"quality\": \"high\",\n    \"detail_level\": \"highly detailed with film-like texture\"\n  }\n}\n```\n```bash\npython /mnt/skills/public/image-generation/scripts/generate.py \\\n  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/star-wars-scene.json \\\n  --reference-images /mnt/user-data/uploads/character-ref.jpg /mnt/user-data/uploads/vehicle-ref.jpg \\\n  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/star-wars-scene-01.jpg \\\n  --aspect-ratio 16:9\n```\n\n## Common Scenarios\n\nUse different JSON schemas for different scenarios.\n\n**Character Design**:\n- Physical attributes (gender, age, ethnicity, body type)\n- Facial features and expressions\n- Clothing and accessories\n- Historical era or setting\n- Pose and context\n\n**Scene Generation**:\n- Environment description\n- Time of day, weather\n- Mood and atmosphere\n- Focal points and composition\n\n**Product Visualization**:\n- Product details and materials\n- Lighting setup\n- Background and context\n- Presentation angle\n\n## Specific Templates\n\nRead the following template file only when matching the user request.\n\n- [Doraemon Comic](templates/doraemon.md)\n\n## Output Handling\n\nAfter generation:\n\n- Images are typically saved in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`\n- Share generated images with user using present_files tool\n- Provide brief description of the generation result\n- Offer to iterate if adjustments needed\n\n## Notes\n\n- Always use English for prompts regardless of user's language\n- JSON format ensures structured, parsable prompts\n- Reference images enhance generation quality significantly\n- Iterative refinement is normal for optimal results\n- For character generation, include the detailed character object plus a consolidated prompt field\n",

The video shows Darcy's agitated declaration, \"You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you,\" followed by Elizabeth's shocked and defiant rejection.\n\nThe scene is set in the candlelit parlor at Hunsford Parsonage, with dramatic lighting that emphasizes the tension between the characters. Darcy appears proud yet vulnerable, while Elizabeth's expression transforms from surprise to righteous anger as she delivers her cutting refusal.\n\nI've presented both the generated video and the reference image used to guide the video generation. The 8-second clip captures the essence of this literary moment where pride and prejudice collide, setting the stage for the characters' eventual transformation.\n\nThe video successfully conveys the emotional depth and historical atmosphere of Austen's masterpiece, bringing this classic confrontation to life in a brief but powerful visual format.",
