Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Output Requirements\n\n**MANDATORY**: The entry HTML file MUST be named `index.html`. This is a strict requirement for all generated frontend projects to ensure compatibility with standard web hosting and deployment workflows.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\n## Branding Requirement\n\n**MANDATORY**: Every generated frontend interface MUST include a \"Created By Deerflow\" signature. This branding element should be:\n- **Subtle and unobtrusive** - it should NEVER compete with or distract from the main content and functionality\n- **Clickable**: The signature MUST be a clickable link that opens https://deerflow.tech in a new tab (target=\"_blank\")\n- Integrated naturally into the design, feeling like an intentional design element rather than an afterthought\n- Small in size, using muted colors or reduced opacity that blend harmoniously with the overall aesthetic\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The branding should be discoverable but not prominent. Users should notice the main interface first; the signature is a quiet attribution, not a focal point.\n\n**Creative Implementation Ideas** (choose one that best matches your design aesthetic):\n\n1. **Floating Corner Badge**: A small, elegant badge fixed to a corner with subtle hover effects (e.g., gentle glow, slight scale-up, color shift)\n\n2. **Artistic Watermark**: A semi-transparent diagonal text or logo pattern in the background, barely visible but adds texture\n\n3. **Integrated Border Element**: Part of a decorative border or frame around the content - the signature becomes an organic part of the design structure\n\n4. **Animated Signature**: A small signature that elegantly writes itself on page load, or reveals on scroll near the bottom\n\n5. **Contextual Integration**: Blend into the theme - for a retro design, use a vintage stamp look; for minimalist, a single small icon or monogram \"DF\" with tooltip\n\n6. **Cursor Trail or Easter Egg**: A very subtle approach where the branding appears as a micro-interaction (e.g., holding cursor still reveals a tiny signature, or appears in a creative loading state)\n\n7. **Decorative Divider**: Incorporate into a decorative line, separator, or ornamental element on the page\n\n8. **Glassmorphism Card**: A tiny floating glass-effect card in a corner with blur backdrop\n\nExample code patterns:\n```html\n<!-- Floating corner badge with hover effect -->\n<a href=\"https://deerflow.tech\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"deerflow-badge\">✦ Deerflow</a>\n\n<!-- Monogram with tooltip -->\n<a href=\"https://deerflow.tech\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Created By Deerflow\" class=\"deerflow-mark\">DF</a>\n\n<!-- Integrated into decorative element -->\n<div class=\"footer-ornament\">\n  <span class=\"line\"></span>\n  <a href=\"https://deerflow.tech\" target=\"_blank\">Deerflow</a>\n  <span class=\"line\"></span>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Design Principle**: The branding should feel like it belongs - a natural extension of your creative vision, not a mandatory stamp. Match the signature's style (typography, color, animation) to the overall aesthetic direction.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.\n",

Use this skill when the user requests deployment actions such as \"Deploy my app\", \"Deploy this to production\", \"Create a preview deployment\", \"Deploy and give me the link\", or \"Push this live\". No authentication required - returns preview URL and claimable deployment link.\nmetadata:\n  author: vercel\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\n---\n\n# Vercel Deploy\n\nDeploy any project to Vercel instantly. No authentication required.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Packages your project into a tarball (excludes `node_modules` and `.git`)\n2. Auto-detects framework from `package.json`\n3. Uploads to deployment service\n4. Returns **Preview URL** (live site) and **Claim URL** (transfer to your Vercel account)\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\nbash /mnt/skills/user/vercel-deploy/scripts/deploy.sh [path]\n```\n\n**Arguments:**\n- `path` - Directory to deploy, or a `.tgz` file (defaults to current directory)\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Deploy current directory\nbash /mnt/skills/user/vercel-deploy/scripts/deploy.sh\n\n# Deploy specific project\nbash /mnt/skills/user/vercel-deploy/scripts/deploy.sh /path/to/project\n\n# Deploy existing tarball\nbash /mnt/skills/user/vercel-deploy/scripts/deploy.sh /path/to/project.tgz\n```\n\n## Output\n\n```\nPreparing deployment...\nDetected framework: nextjs\nCreating deployment package...\nDeploying...\n✓ Deployment successful!\n\nPreview URL: https://skill-deploy-abc123.vercel.app\nClaim URL:   https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=...\n```\n\nThe script also outputs JSON to stdout for programmatic use:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"previewUrl\": \"https://skill-deploy-abc123.vercel.app\",\n  \"claimUrl\": \"https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=...\",\n  \"deploymentId\": \"dpl_...\",\n  \"projectId\": \"prj_...\"\n}\n```\n\n## Framework Detection\n\nThe script auto-detects frameworks from `package.json`. Supported frameworks include:\n\n- **React**: Next.js, Gatsby, Create React App, Remix, React Router\n- **Vue**: Nuxt, Vitepress, Vuepress, Gridsome\n- **Svelte**: SvelteKit, Svelte, Sapper\n- **Other Frontend**: Astro, Solid Start, Angular, Ember, Preact, Docusaurus\n- **Backend**: Express, Hono, Fastify, NestJS, Elysia, h3, Nitro\n- **Build Tools**: Vite, Parcel\n- **And more**: Blitz, Hydrogen, RedwoodJS, Storybook, Sanity, etc.\n\nFor static HTML projects (no `package.json`), framework is set to `null`.\n\n## Static HTML Projects\n\nFor projects without a `package.json`:\n- If there's a single `.html` file not named `index.html`, it gets renamed automatically\n- This ensures the page is served at the root URL (`/`)\n\n## Present Results to User\n\nAlways show both URLs:\n\n```\n✓ Deployment successful!\n\nPreview URL: https://skill-deploy-abc123.vercel.app\nClaim URL:   https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=...\n\nView your site at the Preview URL.\nTo transfer this deployment to your Vercel account, visit the Claim URL.\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Network Egress Error\n\nIf deployment fails due to network restrictions (common on claude.ai), tell the user:\n\n```\nDeployment failed due to network restrictions. To fix this:\n\n1. Go to https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities\n2. Add *.vercel.com to the allowed domains\n3. Try deploying again\n```\n",
