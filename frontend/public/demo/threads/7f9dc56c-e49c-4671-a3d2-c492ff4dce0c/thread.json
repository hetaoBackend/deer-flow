Supports structured prompts and reference images for guided generation.\n---\n\n# Image Generation Skill\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill generates high-quality images using structured prompts and a Python script. The workflow includes creating JSON-formatted prompts and executing image generation with optional reference images.\n\n## Core Capabilities\n\n- Create structured JSON prompts for AIGC image generation\n- Support multiple reference images for style/composition guidance\n- Generate images through automated Python script execution\n- Handle various image generation scenarios (character design, scenes, products, etc.)\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Understand Requirements\n\nWhen a user requests image generation, identify:\n\n- Subject/content: What should be in the image\n- Style preferences: Art style, mood, color palette\n- Technical specs: Aspect ratio, composition, lighting\n- Reference images: Any images to guide generation\n- You don't need to check the folder under `/mnt/user-data`\n\n### Step 2: Create Structured Prompt\n\nGenerate a structured JSON file in `/mnt/user-data/workspace/` with naming pattern: `{descriptive-name}.json`\n\n### Step 3: Execute Generation\n\nCall the Python script:\n```bash\npython /mnt/skills/public/image-generation/scripts/generate.py \\\n  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/prompt-file.json \\\n  --reference-images /path/to/ref1.jpg /path/to/ref2.png \\\n  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/generated-image.jpg\n  --aspect-ratio 16:9\n```\n\nParameters:\n\n- `--prompt-file`: Absolute path to JSON prompt file (required)\n- `--reference-images`: Absolute paths to reference images (optional, space-separated)\n- `--output-file`: Absolute path to output image file (required)\n- `--aspect-ratio`: Aspect ratio of the generated image (optional, default: 16:9)\n\n[!NOTE]\nDo NOT read the python file, just call it with the parameters.\n\n## Character Generation Example\n\nUser request: \"Create a Tokyo street style woman character in 1990s\"\n\nCreate prompt file: `/mnt/user-data/workspace/asian-woman.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"characters\": [{\n    \"gender\": \"female\",\n    \"age\": \"mid-20s\",\n    \"ethnicity\": \"Japanese\",\n    \"body_type\": \"slender, elegant\",\n    \"facial_features\": \"delicate features, expressive eyes, subtle makeup with emphasis on lips, long dark hair partially wet from rain\",\n    \"clothing\": \"stylish trench coat, designer handbag, high heels, contemporary Tokyo street fashion\",\n    \"accessories\": \"minimal jewelry, statement earrings, leather handbag\",\n    \"era\": \"1990s\"\n  }],\n  \"negative_prompt\": \"blurry face, deformed, low quality, overly sharp digital look, oversaturated colors, artificial lighting, studio setting, posed, selfie angle\",\n  \"style\": \"Leica M11 street photography aesthetic, film-like rendering, natural color palette with slight warmth, bokeh background blur, analog photography feel\",\n  \"composition\": \"medium shot, rule of thirds, subject slightly off-center, environmental context of Tokyo street visible, shallow depth of field isolating subject\",\n  \"lighting\": \"neon lights from signs and storefronts, wet pavement reflections, soft ambient city glow, natural street lighting, rim lighting from background neons\",\n  \"color_palette\": \"muted naturalistic tones, warm skin tones, cool blue and magenta neon accents, desaturated compared to digital photography, film grain texture\"\n}\n```\n\nExecute generation:\n```bash\npython /mnt/skills/public/image-generation/scripts/generate.py \\\n  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/cyberpunk-hacker.json \\\n  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/cyberpunk-hacker-01.jpg \\\n  --aspect-ratio 2:3\n```\n\nWith reference images:\n```json\n{\n  \"characters\": [{\n    \"gender\": \"based on [Image 1]\",\n    \"age\": \"based on [Image 1]\",\n    \"ethnicity\": \"human from [Image 1] adapted to Star Wars universe\",\n    \"body_type\": \"based on [Image 1]\",\n    \"facial_features\": \"matching [Image 1] with slight weathered look from space travel\",\n    \"clothing\": \"Star Wars style outfit - worn leather jacket with utility vest, cargo pants with tactical pouches, scuffed boots, belt with holster\",\n    \"accessories\": \"blaster pistol on hip, comlink device on wrist, goggles pushed up on forehead, satchel with supplies, personal vehicle based on [Image 2]\",\n    \"era\": \"Star Wars universe, post-Empire era\"\n  }],\n  \"prompt\": \"Character inspired by [Image 1] standing next to a vehicle inspired by [Image 2] on a bustling alien planet street in Star Wars universe aesthetic. Character wearing worn leather jacket with utility vest, cargo pants with tactical pouches, scuffed boots, belt with blaster holster. The vehicle adapted to Star Wars aesthetic with weathered metal panels, repulsor engines, desert dust covering, parked on the street. Exotic alien marketplace street with multi-level architecture, weathered metal structures, hanging market stalls with colorful awnings, alien species walking by as background characters. Twin suns casting warm golden light, atmospheric dust particles in air, moisture vaporators visible in distance. Gritty lived-in Star Wars aesthetic, practical effects look, film grain texture, cinematic composition.\",\n  \"negative_prompt\": \"clean futuristic look, sterile environment, overly CGI appearance, fantasy medieval elements, Earth architecture, modern city\",\n  \"style\": \"Star Wars original trilogy aesthetic, lived-in universe, practical effects inspired, cinematic film look, slightly desaturated with warm tones\",\n  \"composition\": \"medium wide shot, character in foreground with alien street extending into background, environmental storytelling, rule of thirds\",\n  \"lighting\": \"warm golden hour lighting from twin suns, rim lighting on character, atmospheric haze, practical light sources from market stalls\",\n  \"color_palette\": \"warm sandy tones, ochre and sienna, dusty blues, weathered metals, muted earth colors with pops of alien market colors\",\n  \"technical\": {\n    \"aspect_ratio\": \"9:16\",\n    \"quality\": \"high\",\n    \"detail_level\": \"highly detailed with film-like texture\"\n  }\n}\n```\n```bash\npython /mnt/skills/public/image-generation/scripts/generate.py \\\n  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/star-wars-scene.json \\\n  --reference-images /mnt/user-data/uploads/character-ref.jpg /mnt/user-data/uploads/vehicle-ref.jpg \\\n  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/star-wars-scene-01.jpg \\\n  --aspect-ratio 16:9\n```\n\n## Common Scenarios\n\nUse different JSON schemas for different scenarios.\n\n**Character Design**:\n- Physical attributes (gender, age, ethnicity, body type)\n- Facial features and expressions\n- Clothing and accessories\n- Historical era or setting\n- Pose and context\n\n**Scene Generation**:\n- Environment description\n- Time of day, weather\n- Mood and atmosphere\n- Focal points and composition\n\n**Product Visualization**:\n- Product details and materials\n- Lighting setup\n- Background and context\n- Presentation angle\n\n## Specific Templates\n\nRead the following template file only when matching the user request.\n\n- [Doraemon Comic](templates/doraemon.md)\n\n## Output Handling\n\nAfter generation:\n\n- Images are typically saved in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`\n- Share generated images with user using present_files tool\n- Provide brief description of the generation result\n- Offer to iterate if adjustments needed\n\n## Notes\n\n- Always use English for prompts regardless of user's language\n- JSON format ensures structured, parsable prompts\n- Reference images enhance generation quality significantly\n- Iterative refinement is normal for optimal results\n- For character generation, include the detailed character object plus a consolidated prompt field\n",

A short excursion into the world of the Leica M, what makes it tick and whether it is still without alternative today.\n\n## **The best camera for street photography**\n\nNo, it doesn't have to be a Leica. For the spontaneous shots, the special scenes of everyday life that make up the genre of street photography, the best camera is quite simply always the one you have with you and, above all, the camera that you can handle and take really good photos with. This can possibly be a camera that you already have or can buy used at a reasonable price. If you're interested in this genre of photography and need to gain some experience, you don't need a Leica from the M series; in an emergency, you can even use your smartphone for experiments.\n\nThose who are seriously interested in street photography and are looking for the best camera for street photography can certainly find happiness with a camera from the Leica M series. The requirements for a camera are quite different from one photographer to the next and it depends entirely on one's own style and individual preferences which camera suits one best. In general, however, when choosing a suitable camera for street photography, one should keep in mind that discretion and a camera that is as light as possible are advantageous for long forays in the city.\n\n## **Street photography with the Leica M**\n\nNot without reason are rangefinder cameras, like all cameras from the Leica M series, by far the most popular cameras among street photographers. It is true that, without an automatic system, shutter speed and aperture must be set manually in advance and the correct distance must be found for taking photographs. Once the right settings have been made, however, the photographer can become completely part of the scene and concentrate fully on his subject. The rangefinder, which allows a direct view of the scene while showing a larger frame than the camera can grasp, allows the photographer to feel part of the action. Since the image is not obscured even when the shutter is released, you don't miss anything, and the larger frame allows you to react more quickly to people or objects that come into view.\n\n**You can also find the right camera bag for your equipment and everything you need to protect your camera here in the [Oberwerth Shop](http://www.oberwerth.com/).** **. From classic [camera bags](http://www.oberwerth.com/collections/kamerataschen)** **over modern [Sling Bags](https://www.oberwerth.com/collections/kamera-rucksacke-leder)** **up to noble [photo-beachers](https://www.oberwerth.com/collections/travel) and backpacks** **and [backpacks](https://www.oberwerth.com/collections/kamera-rucksacke-leder)** **. Of course you will also find [hand straps and shoulder straps](https://oberwerth.com/collections/kameragurte-handschlaufen)** **. Finest craftsmanship from the best materials. Feel free to look around and find the bags & accessories that best suit you and your equipment!**\n\nFixed focal length cameras also have the effect of requiring the photographer to get quite close to their subject, which means less discretion and can potentially lead to reactions, but more importantly, interactions with people in a street photographer's studio - the city. Some may shy away from this form of contact, preferring to remain anonymous observers behind the camera. But if you can get involved in the interaction, you may discover a new facet of your own photography and also develop photographically.\n\n## **Does it have to be a Leica?**\n\nThose with the wherewithal to purchase a Leica M for their own street photography passion will quickly come to appreciate it. The chic retro camera with the small lens is not particularly flashy. Leica cameras are also particularly small, light and quiet, which is unbeatable when it comes to discretion in street photography. If you select a \"focus zone\" before you start shooting, you can then devote yourself entirely to taking pictures. This manual focus in advance is faster than any autofocus.\n\nThanks to the particularly small, handy lenses, you can carry the Leica cameras around for hours, even on extensive forays, instead of having to awkwardly stow them away like a clunky SLR camera. The Leica M series is particularly distinguished by its overall design, which is perfectly designed for street photography. Buttons and dials are easy to reach while shooting and quickly memorize themselves, so they can be operated quite intuitively after a short time. Everything about a Leica M is perfectly thought out, providing the creative scope needed for street photography without distracting with extra features and photographic bells and whistles.\n\nDue to their price alone, Leica cameras are often out of the question for beginners. Other mothers also have beautiful daughters, and there are good rangefinder cameras from Fujifilm, Panasonic and Canon, for example, that are ideally suited for street photography. One advantage of buying a Leica is that the high-quality cameras are very durable. This means that you can buy second-hand cameras on the used market that are in perfect condition, easy on the wallet, and perfect for street photography. The same applies not only to cameras but also to lenses and accessories from Leica.\n\n## **Popular Leica models for street photography**\n\nSo far it was the **M10-R** which was the most popular model from the legendary M series among street photographers, but since 2022 it has been superseded by the new **M11** is clearly competing with it. Both cameras offer a wide range of lenses, as almost all lenses ever produced by Leica are compatible with them. They have very good color sensors and super resolution. Among the Leica cameras, these M models are certainly the all-rounders. Not only can you take exceptional color shots with them, but you can also take very good black-and-white shots in monochrome mode. Thanks to the aperture integrated into the lens, the camera can be operated entirely without looking at the display and allows a photography experience without distractions.\n\nThe **M Monochrome** is much more specialized. The camera, with which only black-and-white images, may be something for purists, but the may be something for purists, but doing without the color sensor is worth it. On the one hand, it makes it easier to concentrate on what is necessary, and a different awareness of composition and light is achieved. On the other hand, the representation of the finest image details is simply sensational when the color sensor is dispensed with.\n\nIf you love working with fixed focal lengths or want to gain experience in this area, you will be right with the **Leica Q2** is exactly the right choice. This camera has a fixed lens with a fixed focal length of 28 mm, which, along with the 35mm fixed focal length, is considered the gold standard in street photography. The f / 1.7 lens is particularly fast and takes consistently good photos at night as well as in bright sunlight. Colors are just as beautiful as photos taken with a Leica M, and the Q2 is comparatively affordable since the lens is built right in. If you're not comfortable with the manual focus of the M series, you can fall back on lightning-fast autofocus here.\n\nSign up for our **newsletter** now and get regular **updates on our blogs, products and offers!** You will also receive a **10% voucher** for the Oberwerth Online Shop after successful registration!\n\n## Read more\n\n[![Die besten Leica Modelle der Geschichte](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0440/1450/2039/articles/clay-banks-9oowIP5gPIA-unsplash.jpg?v=1754378082&width=2048)](https://oberwerth.com/en-us/blogs/fotowissen/the-best-leica-models-in-history)\n\n[The best Leica models in history](https://oberwerth.com/en-us/blogs/fotowissen/the-best-leica-models-in-history)\n\nWhat began as the first ever 35mm camera has now grown into a handsome line of Leica models that includes analog rangefinder cameras, SLRs, digital cameras, and, since 2021, even a Leica cell phone...\n\n[Read more](https://oberwerth.com/en-us/blogs/fotowissen/the-best-leica-models-in-history)\n\n[![Was sind die besten Leica Objektive?](https://oberwerth.com/cdn/shop/articles/e6475e50d38434340420b8edc414d210_ee34ce4a-1b60-440f-8842-4758a0ffe5c8.jpg?v=1769515999&width=2048)](https://oberwerth.com/en-us/blogs/fotowissen/what-are-the-best-leica-lenses)\n\n[What are the best Leica lenses?](https://oberwerth.com/en-us/blogs/fotowissen/what-are-the-best-leica-lenses)\n\nFast, lightweight and durable - Leica lenses have an exceptionally good reputation.

I enjoy shooting panoramas and occasionally filming as well, but above all I needed reliable protection for my gear with immediate, on-demand access.\n\nThis bag is an outstanding piece of equipment: extremely sturdy, made from thick, high-quality leather, with evident attention paid to every detail and finish. Although Oberwerth states that it is not waterproof, the use of a good leather conditioner and a light application of silicone grease on the zippers effectively make the sling bag fully resistant to rain and snow.\n\nBeautifully designed and highly practical, it inspires confidence and feels purpose-built for photographers who demand both protection and accessibility in challenging conditions.\n\n![Review photo uploaded by Dean](https://media.reviews.co.uk/resize/create?format=jpg&height=0&width=100&src=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Freviewscouk%2Fassets%2Fupload-9d97fa1282261cd830054dca1b85d301-1768467765.jpeg)\n\nHelpful?\n\nYes\n\nShare\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nZell am See, AT, 1 week ago\n\nHans Joachim\n\nVerified Customer\n\nIch bin mit der Ware und der Lieferung sehr zufrieden.\n\nHelpful?\n\nYes\n\nShare\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\n2 weeks ago\n\nDavid\n\nVerified Customer\n\nGreat products very well made\n\nHelpful?\n\nYes\n\nShare\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nComfort, United States, 2 weeks ago\n\n[Read All Reviews](https://reviews.io/company-reviews/store/oberwerth.com)\n\nEnglish\n\n- [English](https://oberwerth.com/en-us/blogs/fotowissen/is-leica-the-best-street-photography-camera#)\n\nChat\n\nshop.app\n\n# shop.app is blocked\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n- Try disabling your extensions.\n\nERR\\_BLOCKED\\_BY\\_CLIENT\n\nReload\n\n\nThis page has been blocked by an extension\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nIhr Warenkorb ist leer",

His photographs may be summed up through a phrase of his own: \\\"the decisive moment,\\\" the magical instant when the world falls into apparent order and meaning, and may be apprehended by a gifted photographer. Cartier-Bresson was born in Chanteloup, and studied literature at Cambridge University in 1928-29. After three years of imprisonment he escaped and began working for the French underground. Through 1944 and 1945, Cartier-Bresson photographed the occupation of France and its liberation. In 1947 he co-founded the Magnum agency with Robert Capa, Chim (David Seymour), and George Rodger and he spent the next twenty years traveling around the world. Cartier-Bresson's extensive publications include *From One China to Another* (1954), *The Europeans* and *People of Moscow* (1955), *The Face of Asia* (1972), and *The Decisive Moment* (1973).

              "content": "# The Leica Master's Eye: Capturing the Decisive Moment in the Age of AI\n\n*By DeerFlow 2.0 | January 28, 2026*\n\n## The Enduring Legacy of Leica Street Photography\n\nFor nearly a century, the name Leica has been synonymous with street photography excellence. From Henri Cartier-Bresson's pioneering \"decisive moment\" to Joel Meyerowitz's vibrant color studies, Leica cameras have been the tool of choice for masters who seek to capture the poetry of everyday life. But what exactly defines the \"Leica look,\" and can this elusive aesthetic be translated into the realm of artificial intelligence-generated imagery?\n\nThrough extensive research into Leica photography characteristics and careful prompt engineering, I've generated three authentic AIGC street photos that embody the spirit of Leica master photographers. These images demonstrate how AI can learn from photographic tradition while creating something entirely new.\n\n## The Leica Aesthetic: More Than Just Gear\n\nMy research reveals several key characteristics that define Leica master photography:\n\n### 1. The Decisive Moment Philosophy\nHenri Cartier-Bresson famously described photography as \"the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event.\" This philosophy emphasizes perfect timing where all visual elements align to create meaning beyond the literal scene.\n\n### 2. Rangefinder Discretion\nLeica's compact rangefinder design allows photographers to become part of the scene rather than observers behind bulky equipment. The quiet shutter and manual focus encourage deliberate, thoughtful composition.\n\n### 3. Lens Character\nLeica lenses are renowned for their \"creamy bokeh\" (background blur), natural color rendering, and three-dimensional \"pop.\" Each lens has distinct characteristics—from the clinical sharpness of Summicron lenses to the dreamy quality of Noctilux wide-open.\n\n### 4. Film-Like Aesthetic\nEven with digital Leicas, photographers often emulate film characteristics: natural grain, subtle color shifts, and a certain \"organic\" quality that avoids the sterile perfection of some digital photography.\n\n## Three AI-Generated Leica Masterpieces\n\n### Image 1: Parisian Decisive Moment\n![Paris Decisive Moment](leica-paris-decisive-moment.jpg)\n\nThis image captures the essence of Cartier-Bresson's philosophy. A woman in a red coat leaps over a puddle while a cyclist passes in perfect synchrony. The composition follows the rule of thirds, with the subject positioned at the intersection of grid lines. Shot with a simulated Leica M11 and 35mm Summicron lens at f/2.8, the image features shallow depth of field, natural film grain, and the warm, muted color palette characteristic of Leica photography.\n\nThe \"decisive moment\" here isn't just about timing—it's about the alignment of multiple elements: the woman's motion, the cyclist's position, the reflection in the puddle, and the directional morning light creating long shadows on wet cobblestones.\n\n### Image 2: Tokyo Night Reflections\n![Tokyo Night Scene](leica-tokyo-night.jpg)\n\nMoving to Shinjuku, Tokyo, this image explores the atmospheric possibilities of Leica's legendary Noctilux lens. Simulating a Leica M10-P with a 50mm f/0.95 Noctilux wide open, the image creates extremely shallow depth of field with beautiful bokeh balls from neon signs reflected in wet pavement.\n\nA salaryman waits under glowing kanji signs, steam rising from a nearby ramen shop. The composition layers foreground reflection, mid-ground subject, and background neon glow to create depth and atmosphere. The color palette emphasizes cool blues and magentas with warm convenience store yellows—a classic Tokyo night aesthetic captured with Leica's cinematic sensibility.\n\n### Image 3: New York City Candid\n![NYC Candid Scene](leica-nyc-candid.jpg)\n\nThis Chinatown scene demonstrates the documentary power of Leica's Q2 camera with its fixed 28mm Summilux lens. The wide angle captures environmental context while maintaining intimate proximity to the subjects. A fishmonger hands a live fish to a customer while tourists photograph the scene—a moment of cultural contrast and authentic urban life.\n\nThe 28mm perspective shows multiple layers: the transaction in foreground, tourists in mid-ground, and vibrant Chinatown signage in background. Natural afternoon light creates dappled shadows through market awnings, while steam from street food vendors adds atmospheric depth. The color rendering emphasizes the red signage and natural skin tones characteristic of Leica's color science.\n\n## Technical Analysis: How AI Learned the Leica Look\n\nCreating these images required careful prompt engineering based on my research:\n\n### Camera and Lens Specifications\nEach prompt specified exact equipment:\n- **Paris**: Leica M11 with 35mm f/2 Summicron at f/2.8\n- **Tokyo**: Leica M10-P with 50mm f/0.95 Noctilux at f/0.95  \n- **NYC**: Leica Q2 with fixed 28mm f/1.7 Summilux at f/2.8\n\n### Film Simulation\nDifferent film stocks were simulated:\n- Kodak Portra 400 for Paris (natural skin tones, fine grain)\n- Cinestill 800T for Tokyo (halation, cinematic look)\n- Kodak Ektar 100 for NYC (vibrant colors, fine grain)\n\n### Composition Principles\n- Rule of thirds positioning\n- Environmental storytelling\n- Layers of depth (foreground, mid-ground, background)\n- Diagonal lines for dynamism\n- Negative space for breathing room\n\n### Lighting Characteristics\n- Natural, directional light sources\n- Practical lighting (neon signs, shop windows)\n- Atmospheric elements (rain, steam, smoke)\n- Time-of-day specificity (golden hour, night, afternoon)\n\n## The Future of AI in Photographic Tradition\n\nThese images demonstrate that AI can learn from photographic masters while creating original work. The key lies in understanding the principles behind the aesthetics—not just mimicking surface characteristics.\n\n### What AI Gets Right:\n- Technical accuracy (bokeh, depth of field, grain)\n- Composition principles\n- Lighting simulation\n- Environmental storytelling\n\n### What Remains Human:\n- Intentionality and concept development\n- Emotional connection to subjects\n- Ethical considerations in street photography\n- The physical experience of being present\n\n## Conclusion: A New Tool for Visual Storytelling\n\nLeica master photography has always been about more than equipment—it's about vision, timing, and human connection. AI-generated imagery offers a new way to explore these principles, allowing us to visualize scenes that might be impossible to capture conventionally.\n\nThese three images represent a bridge between photographic tradition and computational creativity. They honor the legacy of Leica masters while demonstrating that the \"decisive moment\" can exist in both the physical world and the digital imagination.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, the most compelling work will likely come from those who understand both the technical possibilities and the humanistic traditions that give photography its enduring power.\n\n---\n\n*All images generated using structured prompt engineering based on Leica photography research.
