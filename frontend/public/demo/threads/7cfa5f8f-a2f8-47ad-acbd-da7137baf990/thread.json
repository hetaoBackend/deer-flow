Token costs have dropped 280-fold in two years;[10](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends.html#endnote-10) yet some enterprises are seeing monthly bills in the tens of millions. Only 1% of IT leaders surveyed by Deloitte reported that no major operating model changes were underway.[11](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends.html#endnote-11)Leaders are shifting from incremental IT management to orchestrating human-agent teams, with CIOs becoming AI evangelists. AT&T’s chief information security officer [captured the challenge](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends/2025/att-ai-cybersecurity-practices.html): “What we’re experiencing today is no different than what we’ve experienced in the past. The only difference with AI is speed and impact.”[12](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends.html#endnote-12)Organizations must secure AI across four domains—data, models, applications, and infrastructure—but they also have the opportunity to use AI-powered defenses to fight threats operating at machine speed. #### [Kelly Raskovich](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends.html).

        "content": "# Five trends to watch in the global economy in 2026\n\nWASHINGTON—US President Donald Trump shocked—and re-shocked—the global economy in 2025, but growth powered through. Thanks to the surge in artificial-intelligence (AI) investment and limited inflation from tariffs, it’s clear that many economists’ doomsday predictions never materialized.\n\nBy the end of 2025, forecasts across Wall Street [predicted](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2026-investment-outlooks/) “all-time highs” for the S&P 500 in 2026. Many investors believe that the AI train won’t slow down, central banks will continue cutting rates, and US tariffs will cool down in a midterm year.\n\nBut markets may be confusing resilience for immunity.\n\nThe reality is that several daunting challenges lie ahead in 2026. Advanced economies are piling up the highest debt levels in a century, with many showing little appetite for fiscal restraint. At the same time, protectionism is surging, not just in the United States but around the world. And lurking in the background is a tenuous détente between the United States and China.\n\nIt’s a dangerous mix, one that markets feel far too comfortable overlooking.\n\nHere are five overlooked trends that will matter for the global economy in 2026.\n\n#### **The real AI bubble**\n\nThroughout 2025, stocks of Chinese tech companies listed in Hong Kong skyrocketed. For example, the Chinese chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (known as SMIC) briefly hit gains of [200 percent](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smic-156-surge-already-anticipated-100846509.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANfGA3zCFG9SoG9jgA9TjNhnenhYX1fr3TaGXd9TDB1IfM8ZLmh0SPfV9zroY6detI-XnZ8nWge8OMPMRg2xVAidDNf5IfOZ71NeyeM87CW1fS8StOKB5yCl7gU6iEvkCG36b_raJH_FePXKrPPrGF-570bkutArsNFKTdoVJI81) in October, compared to 2024. The data shows that the AI boom has become global.\n\nEveryone has been talking about the flip side of an AI surge, including the risk of an AI [bubble](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/10/are-we-in-an-ai-bubble-tech-leaders-analysts.html) popping in the United States. But that doesn’t seem to concern Beijing. Alibaba recently announced a $52 billion investment in AI over the next three years. Compare that with a single project led by OpenAI, which is planning to invest $500 billion over the next four years. So the Chinese commitment to AI isn’t all-encompassing for their economy.\n\nOf course, much of the excitement around Chinese tech—and the confidence in its AI development—was driven this past year by the January 2025 release of the [DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/inflection-points/deepseek-poses-a-manhattan-project-sized-challenge-for-trump/). Still, there is a limit to how much Beijing can capitalize on rising tech stocks to draw foreign investment back into China. There’s also the fact that 2024 was such a down year that a 2025 rebound was destined to look strong.\n\nIt’s worth looking at AI beyond the United States. If an AI bubble does burst or deflate in 2026, China may be insulated. It bears some similarities to what happened during the global financial crisis, when US and European banks suffered, but China’s banks, because of their lack of reliance on Western finance, emerged relatively unscathed.\n\n#### **The trade tango**\n\nIn 2026, the most important signal on the future of the global trading order will come from abroad. US tariffs will continue to rise with added Section 232 tariffs on critical industries such as semiconductor equipment and critical minerals, but that’s predictable.\n\nBut it will be worth watching whether the other major economic players follow suit or stick with the open system of the past decades. As the United States imports less from China, but Chinese cheap exports continue to flow, will China’s other major export partners add tariffs? The answer is likely yes.\n\nUS imports from China decreased this past year, while imports by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and European Union (EU) increased. In ASEAN, trade agreements, rapid growth, and interconnected supply chains mean that imports from China will continue to flow uninhibited except for select critical industries.\n\nBut for the EU, 2025 is the only year when the bloc’s purchases of China’s exports do not closely resemble the United States’ purchases. In previous years, they moved in lockstep. In 2026, expect the EU to respond with higher tariffs on advanced manufacturing products and pharmaceuticals from China, since that would be the only way to protect the EU market.\n\n#### **The debtor’s dilemma**\n\nOne of the biggest issues facing the global economy in 2026 is who owns public debt.\n\nIn the aftermaths of the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy needed a hero. Central banks swooped in to save the day and bought up public debt. Now, central banks are “unwinding,” or selling public debt, and resetting their balance sheets. While the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have indicated their intention to slow down the process, other big players, such as the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, are going to keep pushing forward with the unwinding in 2026. This begs the question: If central banks are not buying bonds, who will?\n\nThe answer is private investors.The shift will translate into yields higher than anyone, including Trump and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, want. Ultimately, it is Treasury yields, rather than the Federal Reserve’s policy rate, that dictate the interest on mortgages. So while all eyes will be on the next Federal Reserve chair’s rate-cut plans, look instead at how the new chair—as well as counterparts in Europe, the United Kingdom, and Japan—handles the balance sheet.\n\n#### **Wallet wars**\n\nBy mid-2026, nearly three-quarters of the Group of Twenty (G20) will have tokenized cross-border payment systems, providing a new way to move money between countries using digital tokens. Currently, when you send money internationally, it can go through multiple banks, with each taking a cut and adding delays. With tokenized rails, money is converted into digital tokens (like digital certificates representing real dollars or euros) that can move across borders much faster on modern digital networks.\n\nAs the map below shows, the fastest movers are outside the North Atlantic: China and India are going live with their systems, while Brazil, Russia, Australia, and others are building or testing tokenized cross-border rails.\n\nThat timing collides with the United States taking over the G20 presidency and attempting to refresh a set of technical objectives known among wonks as the “cross-border payments roadmap.” But instead of converging on a faster, shared system, finance ministers are now staring at a patchwork of competing networks—each tied to different currencies and political blocs.\n\nThink of it like the 5G wars, in which the United States pushed to restrict Huawei’s expansion. But this one is coming for wallets instead of phones.\n\nFor China and the BRICS group of countries in particular, these cross-border payments platforms could also lend a hand in their de-dollarization strategies: new rails for trade, energy payments, and remittances that do not have to run through dollar-based correspondent banking. This could further erode the dollar’s [international dominance](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/geoeconomics-center/dollar-dominance-monitor/).\n\nThe question facing the US Treasury and its G20 partners is whether they can still set common rules for this emerging architecture—or whether they will instead be forced to respond to fragmented alternatives, where non-dollar systems are already ahead of the game.\n\n#### **Big spenders**\n\nFrom Trump’s proposal to send two-thousand-dollar [checks](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/08/stimulus-check-trump-tariffs-2000.html) to US citizens (thanks to tariff revenue) to Germany’s aim to ramp up defense spending, major economies across the G20 have big plans for additional stimulus in 2026. That’s the case even though debt levels are already at record highs. Many countries are putting off the tough decisions until at least 2027.\n\n![](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/geoecon-2026-numbers-graph.png)\n\nThis chart shows G20 countries with stimulus plans, comparing their projected gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates for 2026 with their estimated fiscal deficits as a percentage of GDP. It’s a rough metric, but it gives a sense of how countries are thinking about spending relative to growth and debt in the year ahead. Countries below the line are planning to loosen fiscal taps.\n\nOf course, not all stimulus plans are created equal. Ottawa, for example, is spending more on defense and investments aimed at improving the competitiveness of the Canadian economy, while keeping its estimated fiscal deficit at around 1 percentage point of projected 2026 GDP growth. US growth isn’t bad, coming in at a little over 2 percent, but the government plans to run a fiscal deficit of at least 5.5 percent. Russia is attempting to prop up a wartime economy, while China is pursuing ambitious industrial policies and pushing off its local debt problems. And on China, while the chart above shows International Monetary Fund and other official estimates for China’s GDP growth, some economists, including ones from Rhodium Group, [argue](https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Chinas-Economy-Rightsizing-2025-Looking-Ahead-to-2026.pdf) that China’s real GDP growth could be as low as 2.5 percent for 2026, which would push China below the line displayed.\n\nWithin this group, emerging economies are experiencing stronger growth and may have more room to run deficits next year. For advanced economies, that spending tradeoff is much harder to justify.\n\nWhen Trump captured Nicolás Maduro on the first Saturday of the year, there was speculation that when markets opened the following Monday, they might react negatively given a possible geopolitical shock or positively in anticipation that new oil would be coming online. But markets were muted, and they took the news in stride. That has been the modus operandi of markets ever since Trump took office—trying to see past the immediate news and ask what actually matters for economic growth. In 2025, that strategy paid off. But 2026 may look very different.",

        "content": "# The AI advantage dilemma: Security risks and opportunities that lie ahead\n\nEscalating the AI arms race\n---------------------------\n\nAI introduces new vulnerabilities, but it also provides powerful defensive capabilities. Leading organizations are exploring how AI can help them operate at machine speed and adapt to evolving threats in real time. AI-powered cybersecurity solutions help identify patterns humans miss, monitor the entire landscape, speed up threat response, anticipate attacker moves, and automate repetitive tasks. These capabilities are changing how organizations approach cyber risk management.\n\n### Advanced AI-native defense strategies\n\nOne area where cyber teams are taking advantage of AI is red teaming. This involves rigorous stress testing and challenging of AI systems by simulating adversarial attacks to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses before adversaries can exploit them. This proactive approach helps organizations understand their AI systems’ failure modes and security boundaries.\n\nBrazilian financial services firm Itau Unibanco has recruited agents for its red-teaming exercises. It employs a sophisticated approach in which human experts and AI test agents are deployed across the company. These “red agents” use an iterative process to identify and mitigate risks such as ethics, bias, and inappropriate content.\n\n“Being a regulated industry, trust is our No. 1 concern,” says Roberto Frossard, head of emerging technologies at Itau Unibanco. “So that’s one of the things we spent a lot of time on—testing, retesting, and trying to simulate different ways to break the models.”[6](#endnote-6)\n\nAI is also playing a role in adversarial training. This machine learning technique trains models on adversarial examples—inputs designed to fool or attack the model—helping them recognize and resist manipulation attempts and making the systems more robust against attacks.\n\n### Governance, risk, and compliance evolution\n\nEnterprises using AI face new compliance requirements, particularly in health care and financial services, where they often need to explain the decision-making process.[7](#endnote-7) While this process is typically difficult to decipher, certain strategies can help ensure that AI deployments are compliant.\n\nSome organizations are reassessing who oversees AI deployment. While boards of directors traditionally manage this area, there’s a growing trend to assign responsibility to the audit committee, which is well-positioned to continually review and assess AI-related activities.[8](#endnote-8)\n\nGoverning cross-border AI implementations will remain important. The situation may call for data sovereignty efforts to ensure that data is handled locally in accordance with appropriate rules, as discussed in “[The AI infrastructure reckoning](/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends/2026/ai-infrastructure-compute-strategy.html).”\n\n### Advanced agent governance\n\nAgents operate with a high degree of autonomy by design. With agents proliferating across the organization, businesses will need sophisticated agent monitoring to analyze, in real time, agents’ decision-making patterns and communication between agents, and to automatically detect unusual agent behavior beyond basic activity logging. This monitoring enables security teams to identify compromised or misbehaving agents before they cause significant damage.\n\nDynamic privilege management is one aspect of agent governance. This approach allows teams to manage hundreds or even thousands of agents per user while maintaining security boundaries. Privilege management policies should balance agent autonomy with security requirements, adjusting privileges based on context and behavior.\n\nGovernance policies should incorporate life cycle management that controls agent creation, modification, deactivation, and succession planning—analogous to HR management for human employees but adapted for digital workers, as covered in [“The agentic reality check.”](/us/en/insights/topics/technology-management/tech-trends/2026/agentic-ai-strategy.html) This can help limit the problem of orphaned agents, bots that retain access to key systems even after they’ve been offboarded.\n\nAs AI agents become empowered to spin up their own agents, governance will grow more pressing for enterprises. This capability raises significant questions about managing privacy and security, as agents could become major targets for attackers, particularly if enterprises lack visibility into what these agents are doing and which systems they can access.\n\n### The force multiplier effect\n\nMany cyber organizations are using AI as a force multiplier to overcome complex threats. AI models can be layered on top of current security efforts as enhanced defense mechanisms.\n\nAI can assist with risk scoring and prioritization, third-party risk management, automated policy review and orchestration, cybersecurity maturity assessments, and regulatory compliance support. When deployed in these areas, AI capabilities enable security teams to make faster, more informed decisions about resource allocation.\n\nAI is also playing a role in controls testing and automation, secure code generation, vulnerability scanning capabilities, systems design optimization, and model code review processes. This accelerates the identification and remediation of security weaknesses.\n\n### The need for AI blueprints\n\nCybersecurity team operations weren’t designed for AI, but business efforts to implement AI throughout the organization create an opportunity to rethink current cyber practices. As businesses roll out AI (and agents in particular) across their operations, many are choosing to completely reshape the workforce, operating model, governance model, and technology architecture. While rearchitecting operations to take advantage of AI agents, organizations should build security considerations into foundational design rather than treating them as an afterthought. This proactive approach to heading off emerging cyber risks can prepare enterprises for today’s threats and position them well against dangers that are likely to hit two to five years down the road, which is the subject of the following section.",

Generates creative, polished code and UI design that avoids generic AI aesthetics.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\nThis skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic \"AI slop\" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Output Requirements\n\n**MANDATORY**: The entry HTML file MUST be named `index.html`. This is a strict requirement for all generated frontend projects to ensure compatibility with standard web hosting and deployment workflows.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\n## Branding Requirement\n\n**MANDATORY**: Every generated frontend interface MUST include a \"Created By Deerflow\" signature. This branding element should be:\n- **Subtle and unobtrusive** - it should NEVER compete with or distract from the main content and functionality\n- **Clickable**: The signature MUST be a clickable link that opens https://deerflow.tech in a new tab (target=\"_blank\")\n- Integrated naturally into the design, feeling like an intentional design element rather than an afterthought\n- Small in size, using muted colors or reduced opacity that blend harmoniously with the overall aesthetic\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The branding should be discoverable but not prominent. Users should notice the main interface first; the signature is a quiet attribution, not a focal point.\n\n**Creative Implementation Ideas** (choose one that best matches your design aesthetic):\n\n1. **Floating Corner Badge**: A small, elegant badge fixed to a corner with subtle hover effects (e.g., gentle glow, slight scale-up, color shift)\n\n2. **Artistic Watermark**: A semi-transparent diagonal text or logo pattern in the background, barely visible but adds texture\n\n3. **Integrated Border Element**: Part of a decorative border or frame around the content - the signature becomes an organic part of the design structure\n\n4. **Animated Signature**: A small signature that elegantly writes itself on page load, or reveals on scroll near the bottom\n\n5. **Contextual Integration**: Blend into the theme - for a retro design, use a vintage stamp look; for minimalist, a single small icon or monogram \"DF\" with tooltip\n\n6. **Cursor Trail or Easter Egg**: A very subtle approach where the branding appears as a micro-interaction (e.g., holding cursor still reveals a tiny signature, or appears in a creative loading state)\n\n7. **Decorative Divider**: Incorporate into a decorative line, separator, or ornamental element on the page\n\n8. **Glassmorphism Card**: A tiny floating glass-effect card in a corner with blur backdrop\n\nExample code patterns:\n```html\n<!-- Floating corner badge with hover effect -->\n<a href=\"https://deerflow.tech\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"deerflow-badge\">✦ Deerflow</a>\n\n<!-- Monogram with tooltip -->\n<a href=\"https://deerflow.tech\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Created By Deerflow\" class=\"deerflow-mark\">DF</a>\n\n<!-- Integrated into decorative element -->\n<div class=\"footer-ornament\">\n  <span class=\"line\"></span>\n  <a href=\"https://deerflow.tech\" target=\"_blank\">Deerflow</a>\n  <span class=\"line\"></span>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Design Principle**: The branding should feel like it belongs - a natural extension of your creative vision, not a mandatory stamp. Match the signature's style (typography, color, animation) to the overall aesthetic direction.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.\n",
